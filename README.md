# Network Security Confidence Analysis

This research attempts to evaluate sets of network metrics in order to assign a relative security confidence score to a particular network segment or flow.  This confidence score can then be used to assess the relative security of that segment, before, during and after sensitive data transmission.  While this research is primarily interested in Software Defined Networks (SDN) and SDN/hybrid networks, the evaluation of network metrics also spans traditional networks and the analysis can be included for these elements.

Our work is being developed in SDN northbound applications that are SDN controller agnostic.  We use OpenDaylight as the primary controller due to it's robust API framework and the availability of many other SDN northbound applications.
